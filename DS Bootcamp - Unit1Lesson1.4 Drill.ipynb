We should compare that result with 2-3 tests made on our own. If the average time is far from our tested times it means something is going on at client level that he does not clearly understand and he is not able to pass easily. Also the median time could be helpful just in case there isn't some users that are doing some other activities while filling in the data, which could skew the average.\n",

Maybe there are some complicated questions which the user doesn't want or doesn't know how to answer. Or maybe there is a bug in the process that no one reported.\n",

If the number of signup users is low it means the information from the website was not convincing or that the process is cumbersome and should be revised.\n",
