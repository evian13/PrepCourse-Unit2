    "1. <u>Selection bias(sampling procedure)</u>, also called selection bias: When a sample differs from the population in some way – more women, younger, richer, more outgoing, etc – then conclusions based on that sample <b>may not</b> apply to the population. \n",
    "> Selection bias can be avoided by choosing the sample  <font color='green'><i><b>randomly</i></b></font> from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <u>Bias in assignment to conditions</u> is similar to selection bias because it also represents a failure of randomness.  The sample is supposed to be separated into groups that are similar to one another.\n",
    " Example: comparing the effect of sprinkles on liking ice cream. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <u>Contextual bias:</u> Example: ... Unfortunately, what you don't know is that the heater was broken in group 1's room, and the temperature was 90 degrees. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. <u>Observer bias:</u> bias can come from the people running the study. The best way to avoid it is to make sure that the people who interact with study participants <b>don't expect</b> a particular result.\n"
